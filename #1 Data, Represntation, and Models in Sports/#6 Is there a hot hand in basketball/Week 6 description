This week studies an interesting topic in sport, the hot hand. We will introduce the concept of hot hand and discuss the academic research that examines 
whether the hot hand is a phenomenon or a fallacy. We will demonstrate how to analytically test the hot hand using the NBA shot log data. 
We will test whether NBA players have hot hand by computing conditional probabilities and autocorrelation coefficients as well as performing 
regression analyses.

Learning Objectives
  Describe and explain the “hot hand phenomenon” originated from basketball
  Generate hypotheses to test the hot hand phenomenon
  Identify relevant variables in the basketball dataset to test the hypothesis
  Identify the appropriate statistical methods to test the hypothesis and perform the analyses in Python
  Draw inferences from the hypothesis testing
