This week introduces the fundamentals of regression analysis. We will discuss how to perform regression analysis using Python
and how to interpret regression output. We will use NHL data to estimate multiple regression models to identify the team level performance factors 
that affect the team's winning percentage. We will also use cricket data from the Indian Premier League to run regression analyses to examine whether
player performance impacts player salary.

Learning Objectives
  Understand the basic concept of regression analysis and its advantage over correlation analyses
  Identify the dependent variables and independent variables in the data
  Run ordinary least square regression using Python
  Explain the meaning of estimated coefficients and describe the estimated effect of each independent variable
  Evaluate the significance of the estimated impact using t-statistics
  Evaluate the overall performance of the linear model by interpreting R-Squared
