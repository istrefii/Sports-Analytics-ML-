In this module we estimate the relationship between MLB player salaries and their performance statistics, OBP (on base percentage) and SLG (slugging). 
The results appear to confirm the Moneyball story - OBP was undervalued relative to SLG prior to the publication of Moneyball, while after publication 
the relative significance is reversed.
