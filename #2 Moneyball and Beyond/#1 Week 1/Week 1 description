In this module we introduce the Moneyball story and explore the method used to test that story. 
We begin the process of replicating the moneyball test by establishing the relationship between team winning and 
two performance statistics - on base percentage (OBP) and slugging percentage (SLG).

Learning Objectives
  Identify the testable hypotheses in the Moneyball story
  Navigate the Lahman baseball database
  Organize the data to calculate OBP and SLG
