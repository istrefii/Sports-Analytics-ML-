In this module, we will focus on what we have introduced as “external” measures. We will point out some of the (inaccurate) assumptions that are made 
regarding external measures of “load” and “effort”. In addition, we will outline how the continuous use of wearable devices has led to new opportunities 
for quantifying effort as well as (in theory) reducing injury and improving performance. We will finish by describing the “acute to chronic workload” and
the reasons it has gained a lot of attention in the past several years.

Learning Objectives
  Define how accelerometry measures are related to training load
  Introduce the concept of relative and absolute intensity (as external sensors do not measure relative intensity)
  Outline the topic of the acute to chronic workload ratio (ACWR)
  Describe the endpoints / methods used to determine the "best" ACWR (and the evidence that supports the use of ACWR)
  Outline the use of external measures to predict endpoints (e.g. injury) via machine learning
