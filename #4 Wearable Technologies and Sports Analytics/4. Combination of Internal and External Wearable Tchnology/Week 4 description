In this module, we combine external and internal measures to provide a much more nuanced look at training and recovery. 
The external measures can provide a highly quantified evaluation of the movements and motions that have taken place, while the internal measures provide 
feedback about how the athlete is tolerating the training. Combining them can be instrumental for evaluating performance improvements and preventing 
or reducing overuse injuries.

Learning Objectives
  Evaluate the correlation between the internal and external measures of load.
  Explain the usefulness of being able to combine external and internal measures for a more complete evaluation of athlete stress and recovery
  Outline how the combination of internal and external measures during an exercise session can be used to predict aerobic fitness
  Describe the physiological relationship between internal measures like heart rate with external measures such as accelerometry density and GPS velocity
