In this module, we will discuss the exciting new global metrics that have been developed and/or used by many of the consumer devices that are available 
today. Although these new metrics are exciting, we want to be cognizant of the limitations of these devices. Therefore, we will discuss what sensors 
are actually employed to provide these new metrics and highlight where validation is feasible.

Learning Objectives
  Outline the utility and dangers of “global metrics” being used by wearables today
  Describe the sensors used to predict global metrics such as “stress scores” and “body battery”
  Differentiate “global metrics” that can be effectively validated from those that can NOT be validated (based on the availability of a “gold standard” or “ground truth” measure)
  Outline the sensors that are used to evaluate “sleep stage” and sleep scores with current wearable devices
