In this module, we will introduce different types of wearable devices that are used by athletes and teams to improve training and recovery. 
We will start by highlighting what types of sensors are used within the wearable devices and how the data coming from these sensors can provide insights, 
such as training intensity and or physiologic “readiness”.

Learning Objectives
  Describe the "global metrics" that wearables (now) provide and speculate the sensors that are used to predict these global measures (e.g., sleep quality, "body battery", and aerobic fitness scores)
  Identify examples of wearables that could assist teams in quantifying the training load (and/or recovery) in different sports
  Describe how external and internal measures of “load” differ and provide examples of internal and external measures
  Differentiate between basic devices that quantify external versus internal measures
