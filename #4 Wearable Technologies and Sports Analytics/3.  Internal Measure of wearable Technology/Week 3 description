In this module, we will dive more into the physiology of training and recovery, focusing on what we have introduced as “internal” measures. 
We will further explore the use of internal sensors to provide a glimpse of how the individual athlete is responding to the stress induced 
by training and/or competition. We will also highlight the pros and cons of using internal measures to evaluate individual and team training and recovery.

Learning Objectives
  Evaluate the pros and cons of using different internal measures to determine training-related stress: heart rate / breathing rate / skeletal muscle 
oxygenation / muscle activation

  Describe the benefits of determining the “relative exercise intensity” as opposed to the absolute exercise intensity
  Discuss the utility of heart rate variability (HRV) measures for evaluating recovery and training stress
  Compare and contrast different internal measures of stress for various sports (e.g., soccer, basketball, cricket, curling)
  Compare and contrast the use of wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG) versus chest strap-based electrocardiography (ECG) heart rate data
