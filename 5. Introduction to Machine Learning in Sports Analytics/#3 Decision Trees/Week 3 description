This week will focus on interpretable methods for machine learning with a particular focus on decision trees. Students will 
learn how these models work in general, and see special uses of decision trees in combination with regression methods. In this week students will come 
to better understand how the python sklearn toolkit can be used for a breadth of supervised learning tasks.

Learning Objectives
  Adding new data to an existing analysis to improve performance
  Understand what impurity is in a decision tree, and what the gini is
  Understand the combination of decision trees with regression
  Understand the benefits of a decision tree over other approaches, e.g. interpretability
  Understand a classification decision tree
