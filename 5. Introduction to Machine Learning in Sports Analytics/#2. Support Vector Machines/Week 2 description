In this week students will learn how Support Vector Machines (SVM) work, and will experience these models when looking at both baseball and wearable data. 
Coming out of the week students will have experience building SVMs with real data and will be able to apply them to problems of their own.

Learning Objectives
  Exploring how SVMs can be used to classify boxing punches based on wearable data
  Understanding how the SVM can be used to predict pitch results in MLB based on ball data
  Understanding how training and testing data affects the results of support vector machine models
  Experience building a support vector machine
  Understand what a support vector machine is a high level
