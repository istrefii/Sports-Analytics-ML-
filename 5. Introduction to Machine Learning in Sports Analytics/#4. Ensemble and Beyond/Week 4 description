In this week of the course students will learn how many different models can be used together through ensembles, including the random forest method as 
a common use, as well as more general methods available in sklearn such as stacking and bagging. By the end of this week students will have a broad 
understanding of how methods such as SVMs, decision trees, and logistic regression can be used together to solve a problem with increasing performance.


Learning Objectives
  Understand the benefit of an ensemble, and how to apply them more generally in sklearn
  Understand the different kinds of ensembles that exist
  Be exposed to a breadth of contexts where analytics and athletics overlap
  Understand the challenge and issues in collecting data specifically
